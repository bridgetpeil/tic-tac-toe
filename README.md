# Ultimate tic-tac-toe

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is an advanced and strategic twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It is played on a 3x3 grid of smaller 3x3 tic-tac-toe boards, creating a challenging and dynamic gameplay experience.

1. Board Structure: The game consists of nine 3x3 tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3x3 grid.
2. Turns and Movement: Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) on any of the smaller boards. The position of the mark within a smaller board determines which of the nine smaller boards the next player must play on.
3. Winning a Small Board: A player wins a smaller board by aligning three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Once a smaller board is won, it is considered claimed by that player and can no longer be played in.
4. Winning the Game: The ultimate goal is to win three of the larger 3x3 boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), achieving victory on the meta-board level.
5. Full Boards: If a player is directed to a board that is already won or fully occupied, they can place their mark on any of the remaining available boards.
